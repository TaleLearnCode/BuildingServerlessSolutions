[Building Serverless Solutions with Azure and .NET](../../README.md) \ [Jasper (July 2024)](README.md) \

# Technologies and Services Covered [^1]

During this workshop, you will gain exposure to the following technologies and Azure services:

## Azure Functions

**Azure Functions** is a serverless computing service that allows you to run small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. This service is ideal for building microservices due to its scalability and flexibility. Key features include:

- **Serverless Compute**: Execute code on demand without the need to manage infrastructure.
- **Event-Driven Triggers and Bindings**: Automate responses to events from various sources, such as HTTP requests, messages in a queue, or changes in a database.

## Azure Event Grid

**Azure Event Grid** is a fully managed event routing service that enables you to build event-driven applications. It follows a publish-subscribe model, making it easier to integrate and react to events in real time. Key features include:

- **Publish-Subscribe Model**: Decouple event producers from event consumers for more flexible and scalable architectures.
- **Real-Time Event Delivery**: Ensure events are delivered promptly to the appropriate subscribers.

## Azure Logic Apps

**Azure Logic Apps** is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows. It is particularly useful for coordinating microservices and integrating with various services. Key features include:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Design workflows that integrate with different systems and services.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connects effortlessly with other Azure services and numerous third-party applications.

## Azure Cosmos DB

**Azure Cosmos DB** is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. Key features include:

- **Globally Distributed**: Provides low-latency access to data by distributing it across multiple regions.
- **Multi-Model Database**: Supports various data models such as key-value, documents, graphs, and column-family data.
- **Storage for Various Data**: Efficiently stores configuration data, recipes, and user profiles, making it versatile for different applications.

## Application Insights

**Application Insights** is an application performance management service that provides monitoring and diagnostics for your applications. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and how they can be improved. Key features include:

- **Monitoring and Performance Insights**: Track the performance and usage of your applications in real time.
- **Optimization**: Gain actionable insights to optimize your solution based on collected data.

------

Each of these services plays a crucial role in building robust, scalable, and efficient serverless solutions on the Azure platform. Understanding their capabilities and how they integrate will empower you to create sophisticated applications that meet modern demands.
